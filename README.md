# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project
This game is inspired by the classic game Frogger and is a project for the Front-End Nanodegree from Udacity. This project utilizes Object Oriented JavaScript concepts. 

## How To Play
Use the arrow keys to move your player across the screen, to the water. Don't touch the bugs (*gross*) or you'll have to start all over.
